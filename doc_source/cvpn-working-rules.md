# Authorization rules<a name="cvpn-working-rules"></a>

Authorization rules act as Ô¨Årewall rules that grant access to networks\. By adding authorization rules, you grant specific clients access to the specified network\. You should have an authorization rule for each network you want to grant access to\. You can add authorization rules to a Client VPN endpoint using the console and the AWS CLI\.

**Note**  
Client VPN uses longest prefix matching when evaluating authorization rules\. See the troubleshooting topic [Authorization rules for Active Directory groups not working as expected](troubleshooting.md#ad-group-auth-rules) and [Route priority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#route-tables-priority) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* for more details\.

## Add an authorization rule to a Client VPN endpoint<a name="cvpn-working-rule-authorize"></a>

**To add an authorization rule to a Client VPN endpoint using AWS Management Console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the authorization rule, choose **Authorization rules**, and choose **Add authorization rule**\.

1. For **Destination network to enable access**, enter the IP address, in CIDR notation, of the network that you want users to access \(for example, the CIDR block of your VPC\)\.

1. Specify which clients are allowed to access the specified network\. For **For grant access to**, do one of the following:
   + To grant access to all clients, choose **Allow access to all users**\.
   + To restrict access to specific clients, choose **Allow access to users in a specific access group**, and then for **Access group ID**, enter the ID for the group to grant access to\. For example, the security identifier \(SID\) of an Active Directory group, or the ID/name of a group defined in a SAML\-based identity provider \(IdP\)\.
     + \(Active Directory\) To get the SID, you can use the Microsoft Powershell [Get\-ADGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroup) cmdlet, for example:

       ```
       Get-ADGroup -Filter 'Name -eq "<Name of the AD Group>"'
       ```

       Alternatively, open the Active Directory Users and Computers tool, view the properties for the group, go to the Attribute Editor tab, and get the value for `objectSID`\. If necessary, first choose **View**, **Advanced Features** to enable the Attribute Editor tab\.
     + \(SAML\-based federated authentication\) The group ID/name should match the group attribute information that is returned in the SAML assertion\.

1. For **Description**, enter a brief description of the authorization rule\.

1. Choose **Add authorization rule**\.

**To add an authorization rule to a Client VPN endpoint \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the [authorize\-client\-vpn\-ingress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-client-vpn-ingress.html) command\.

## Remove an authorization rule from a Client VPN endpoint<a name="cvpn-working-rule-revoke"></a>

By deleting an authorization rule, you remove access to the specified network\. 

You can remove authorization rules from a Client VPN endpoint using the console and the AWS CLI\.

**To remove an authorization rule from a Client VPN endpoint \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint to which the authorization rule is added and choose **Authorization rules**\.

1. Select the authorization rule to delete, choose **Remove authorization rule**, and choose **Remove authorization rule**\.

**To remove an authorization rule from a Client VPN endpoint \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the [revoke\-client\-vpn\-ingress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/revoke-client-vpn-ingress.html) command\.

## View authorization rules<a name="cvpn-working-rule-view"></a>

You can view authorization rules for a specific Client VPN endpoint using the console and the AWS CLI\.

**To view authorization rules \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Client VPN Endpoints**\.

1. Select the Client VPN endpoint for which to view authorization rules and choose **Authorization rules**\.

**To view authorization rules \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the [describe\-client\-vpn\-authorization\-rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-client-vpn-authorization-rules.html) command\.
