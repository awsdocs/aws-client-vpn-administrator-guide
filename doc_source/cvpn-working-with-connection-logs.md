# Working with connection logs<a name="cvpn-working-with-connection-logs"></a>

You can enable connection logging for a new or existing Client VPN endpoint, and start capturing connection logs\.

Before you begin, you must have a CloudWatch Logs log group in your account\. For more information, see [Working with Log Groups and Log Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide*\. Charges apply for using CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\.

When you enable connection logging, you can specify the name of a log stream in the log group\. If you do not specify a log stream, the Client VPN service creates one for you\.
