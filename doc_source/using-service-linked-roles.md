# Using service\-linked roles for Client VPN<a name="using-service-linked-roles"></a>

AWS Client VPN uses AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)[ service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role)\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Client VPN\. Service\-linked roles are predefined by Client VPN and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\.
